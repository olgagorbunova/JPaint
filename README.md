## Assignmet 1

In this assignment, I have created Class __Assignment1__.
This class includes static fields and methods that facilitate calculation of circle or rectangle area and circumference, as well as _main_ method to run the program.
To read user input, I created an instance of a __Scanner class__ object with _System.in_.
